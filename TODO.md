# TODO: Make Project Responsive and Production-Ready

## Responsiveness Improvements
- [x] Update App.css with additional media queries for font sizes, button sizes, and padding across breakpoints (xs, sm, md, lg)
- [x] Update index.css with responsive body styles, ensuring no overflow issues and touch-friendly elements
- [x] Review and enhance all dashboard components for mobile responsiveness (Grid, Stack, breakpoints) - check InterviewDashboard.jsx for fixed styles
- [ ] Ensure Sidebar and Topbar are fully responsive
- [x] Add touch-friendly interactions (larger buttons, swipe gestures if applicable)

## Production Advancements
- [ ] Add lazy loading for dashboard components in EdupulseLayout.jsx
- [ ] Create and integrate ErrorBoundary component
- [ ] Memoize components using React.memo where appropriate
- [ ] Improve accessibility (aria labels, keyboard navigation)
- [ ] Add PWA features: service worker and manifest.json
- [ ] Optimize performance: code splitting, bundle analysis
- [ ] Add loading states and error handling in services
- [ ] Update package.json for production build optimizations

## Testing and Verification
- [ ] Test responsiveness on various screen sizes using browser tools
- [ ] Verify PWA functionality
- [ ] Run build and check for errors
